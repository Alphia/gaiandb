Benefits of virtualisation / data federation layer provided by Gaian:

- Reduced Maintenance
	-> Using simplified abstract data model as opposed to full physical data model for each back-end
	-> Views do not need to be created in back-end databases
	-> Data sets from separate providers can be joined with SQL + configuration only (no need for code)
	-> Many types of data-sources are supported out-of-the-box (including RDBMS tables, structured text files or XL spreadsheets)
	-> Other data-sources can be exposed via a Gaian Java plugin interface wrapper.
	-> Simplified model for Migrating/swapping underlying data-sources - only requires configuration updates.

- Provenance
	-> Gaian provides provenance information for every data record.
	-> This facilitates development of Governance aspects which can also be applied at the Gaian layer.

- Ownership
	-> Gaian nodes can be attributed to each data owner.
	-> Data owners provide/deny access to their data as they wish - Graphical/intuitive tools for this are in development.
	-> Intermediary data stores for published data are no longer required.

- Distributed Access + Scalability
	-> A plurality of interconnected Gaian nodes provides the ability to connect and query through any node.
	-> Nodes can be configured differently to allow access to more or less data structures.
	-> Gaian networks can provide scalability by attributing distinct data set partitions to different Gaian instances.

- Distributed Processing
	-> Processing functions can be deployed dynamically (in a JAR file). Gaian does not need restarting.

- Policy
	-> Access rules can be implemented to cover access to all data providers (incl. files etc) in one place.
	-> Policy functions can be deployed dynamically (in a JAR file). Gaian does not need to be restarted.

- Caching
	-> Gaian can act as a cache location for pre-processed results, faster access, etc
	-> Gaian can also host surrogate key tables for linking different datasets together (e.g. same locations expressed in different languages)

- Real-time data
	-> Gaian provides access to current endpoint data - as opposed to "old" data exported by data owner.
